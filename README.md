# Cryptocurrency TA 
This application performs Technical Analysis on cryptocurrency. Technical Analysis is a very common technique stock traders use to evaluate the valuation of an asset on pure math and psychology. Although it isn't a bullet-proof trading method, by utilizing strong technical and fundamental analysis, one can usually trade and be more successful than not. 

This program utilizes CryptoCompare's API to grab historical data on difference kinds of cryptocurrencies. From there, I wrote the python code to do the acutal calculations for the technical indicators. From there, I used Dash by Plotly to generate the actual graph.

## TODO:

I plan to roll this out as a full website on it's own eventually. For right now, it's still a work in progress.
